I'm a third-year CSE student at [IIITD](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/), a Google Summer of Code 2019 [student](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/6144888880496640/) under [VideoLAN](https://www.videolan.org/index.html) and an intern at Expedia for Summer 2020.

My expertise lies in Cloud (AWS,GCP,Spark,Vault), Frontend(Qt,HTML/CSS,Unity), Database (MongoDB, Elasticsearch, SQL, Logstash) and Deep Learning (mainly Computer Vision).

Here is my [Resume](https://rohanrajpal.github.io/blog/resume/Rohan_Resume.pdf).

### Engineering

Some of my coursework projects include:

- Implementing the Go-Back-N protocol in Python
- [Simulating a computer network](https://github.com/rohanrajpal/ns3_assignments) using ns-3 and evaluate its performance in C++
- Find [diseases in crops](https://zindi.africa/competitions/iclr-workshop-challenge-1-cgiar-computer-vision-for-crop-disease) using computer vision and deep learning techniques (Pytorch,Fastai).
- Find patterns in shallow clouds using satellite imagery using deep learning techniques (Pytorch,Fastai).
- Implementing [demand paging](https://github.com/rohanrajpal/CSE231-OS-Xv6-Assignment) in Xv6 in C
- Implementing [priority scheduling](https://github.com/rohanrajpal/CSE231-OS-Pintos) in Pintos in C
- Implement a [custom Linux shell](https://github.com/rohanrajpal/CSE231-OS-Shell-Assignment) using C
- Implementing a [Merkle tree](https://github.com/rohanrajpal/CSE231-OS-Merkle-Tree) in C
- Made a [replica](https://github.com/rohanrajpal/APGame) of the popular Snake Vs Block using Java and JavaFX

Independent projects:

- I wrote a [recommender system for movies](https://github.com/rohanrajpal/movie-recommender-system). Implemented user-user and item-item collaborative filtering in Python. Used Flask, Javascript to build the web app and deployed it to Heroku.
- Made a [mini-ERP system](https://github.com/rohanrajpal/ERPSystem), an Android app in Java using Firebase for handling the data

### Research

- Undergraduate Researcher, [Precog](http://precog.iiitd.edu.in/). The social computing lab of IIITD.
- Working on analyzing the social media data of an Indian app. Characterizing the role of the NaMo app in shaping political discourse on social media
- Fuzzy matching at scale, TF-IDF matrices cosine similarity, Elasticsearch

### Community and Leadership

I like contributing to the community, here's what I'm trying to do from my side:

- Lead and founder, [Developer Students Club](http://dsc.iiitd.edu.in/) of IIITD.
- Mentor, [Student Mentorship Programme](https://www.iiitd.edu.in/mentorprogram/):  
  - Mentoring 7 freshmen and helping them with their academic, social and personal issues.
